Record of my custom keybinds/useful motions:



Custom Keybinds:
    
    These are my custom keybinds, also you can look at keymaps.lua for the actual code. The leader key is space right now.

        <Space>w    - Write to file.
        <Space>q    - Quit current editor.

        jj          - Return to normal mode from insert. Have to type this quickly to trigger.
        <Space>n    - Cycle to prev buffer.
        <Space>m    - Cycle to next buffer.

        <Space>h    - Focus on left window.
        <Space>l    - Focus on right window.
        <Space>k    - Focus on up window.
        <Space>j    - Focus on down window.

Useful motions:
    
    I would like to keep notes on how these all work, not just random commands but notes on how parts of a command function together:

        "+p         - This pastes from the system clipboard.
	    ggdG	    - This deletes whole file. gg takes cursor to start of file. Need to figure out what dG does exactly.
        G           - Take cursor to end of file.
        gg"+yG      - Copies entire file into system clipboard. gg goes to file start, "+ is sys clipbaord register, y yanks, G takes to end of file.

    Navigation motions:
        
        0           - Beginning of current line.
        $           - End of current line.
        e           - Move to back of current word.
        Ctrl-d      - half-page down
        Ctre-u      - half-page up
        Ctrl-f      - full page forward
        Ctrl-b      - full page backward        
        :20         - Move to line 20

    Buffer Motions:
        
        :b <file_name>      - Pulls up file_name in current window. Buffer must already be open
        :bn                 - Pulls up next buffer in the current window.       I am most likely going to make a keybind for this.
        :bp                 - Goes to previous buffer.
        :b <num>            - Goes to buffer with this number.
        :bd                 - Closes buffer in current window. This is kinda wonky. Not sure that I love this.
