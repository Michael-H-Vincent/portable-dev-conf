Record of my custom keybinds/useful motions:



Custom Keybinds:

    
    These are my custom keybinds for normal neovim features.

        <Space>w    - Write to file.
        <Space>q    - Quit current editor.

        jj          - Return to normal mode from insert.
        <Space>n    - Cycle to prev buffer.
        <Space>m    - Cycle to next buffer.
		<Space>u    - Close current buffer.
        <Space>e    - Pop up error message. 

        <ALT>h    - Focus on left window.
        <ALT>l    - Focus on right window.
        <ALT>k    - Focus on up window.
        <ALT>j    - Focus on down window.


	These are binds for important plugins:

        <Space>ll   `:VimtexCompile`           (toggle compile)
        <Space>lv   `:VimtexView`              (view PDF)
        <Space>le   `:VimtexErrors`            (show errors)
        <Space>lo   `:VimtexCompileOutput`     (output log)
        <Space>lk   `:VimtexStop`              (stop compile)
        <Space>lc   `:VimtexClean`             (cleanup aux files)

        <Space>hx   (toggles hexview)

		<Space>o	(open file)
		<Space>s	(live grep, across code base)
		<Space>f	(fuzzy find)
		<Space>g	(jump to defintion) --not working rn

		gcc			(comments current line linewise) --in normal mode
		gbc			(comments current line blockwise) --in normal

		gc			(comments linewise) --in visual
		gb			(comments blockwise) --in visual
		
Navigation Motions to remember: (i will delete and replace these once i have them down)

        W (or W/E)  does the same thing as w/e/b but goes by spaces
      
        H (L/M)     move cursor to high, low, middle.
        zt (zb/zz)  reposition cursor and keep line same

        f{char}     find char on that line use ; to repeat (prolly wont use that part)
        t{char}     ^same thing but one before that char 
        /<pattern>      searches for that pattern use n/N for next/prev

Useful motions:


        :%s/old/new/gc      (does find and replace for whole file
                             g means it does all instances on the
                             line and c requires confirmation)

        :.,$s/old/new/gc    (does find and replace from current line
                             to end of file, same gc meanings)
